# PHP User Auth
A simple user authentication system built with [PHP Basic Framework](https://github.com/connorabbas/basic-framework)

Not meant for production use.

## About
- User registration 
- Login / Logout functionality
- Basic CRUD operations
- Page access restrictions for users or guests

The main purpose of this application was to do a trial run of sorts on my PHP Basic Framework, to work out the kinks and nuances.
